# I just quit Spotify

The big trigger was my favorite band _King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard_ leaving Spotify ([Vice covered it][1], [Variety too][2], and [Diffuser gave more context][3]).  
But the real frustration hit when I discovered that the lo-fi jazz I’d been listening to was actually **AI-generated** ([Reddit thread here][4]).

## Echoes from the deep

Yeah, I fell for it... and I felt betrayed.

It started when I thought: _this music is almost too clean._ So I tried to find out who played the drums. No name. Weird. Maybe a new band? Oh, 2025 release... pretty new. But wait—**seven albums already?**

I’m used to King Gizzard’s crazy output, but this felt impossible. And it was. Turns out, they found the sounds that tickle people like me, generated a bunch of artwork mimicking other artists, and handed me nothing more than an echo of a real band. **Fuck that.**

## Old school

So I grabbed all the download codes I could find, installed _Petrichor_ on macOS ([GitHub repo here][5], and some good chatter on [Reddit][6]) and _Doppler_ on iOS. Both are great, btw.

Now I’ve got a music folder full of FLACs and a Bandcamp wishlist overflowing. I even ripped the CDs I already owned.

Feels good.

## Discovery

Finding new music has always been one of my favorite things—like when I stumbled onto the band _Chartreuse_ (love them).

So now I’m on the hunt for blogs or indie radio stations that can help me discover fresh stuff. Hopefully it’s more fun than an algorithm.
