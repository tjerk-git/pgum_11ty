# Hello, its my Tjerk, your favorite Internet Nutritionist

Just like a traditional dietitian helps you understand what you eat, how it affects your body, and how to build healthier habits, I'm here to do the same for your technology consumption.

### Welcome to Doomscroll December Participants!
If you're here from the Doomscroll December challenge, welcome! You are free to use any of these tips and tricks to reclaim your time. If you have your own tips or want to share your journey, please message me at [hello@potloodgum.com](mailto:hello@potloodgum.com).

Also, GREAT F*CKING JOB, *[look at you, who would have thought huh? not me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yd3lQVbkYc)*



We live in an age of infinite digital abundance. Information, entertainment, and connection are available on tap, 24/7. But just because the buffet is open all night doesn't mean we should never stop eating.

Most of us are consuming "junk tech"—content that is highly processed, addictive, and ultimately leaves us feeling drained rather than nourished.

*Bon appétit.*

## Why We Need a Diet

If you ate fast food for every meal, you'd feel sluggish, your sleep would suffer, and your long-term health would deteriorate. Digital consumption is no different.

- **Mindless Snacking:** Checking your phone every 5 minutes "just in case".
- **Binge Eating:** Losing three hours to a TikTok, Reels , Shorts hole.
- **Empty Calories:** Doomscrolling through news that makes you anxious but gives you no agency to act.


### Adding Friction
We often open apps unconsciously. It's a muscle memory: unlock phone -> swipe -> open Instagram. We need to break that loop.

**The Fix:**
- **[One Sec](https://one-sec.app/)**: This app forces you to take a deep breath before opening a distracting app.
- **How it works:** When you tap on Twitter or TikTok, *One Sec* intercepts the tap, covers the screen, and asks you to breathe for a few seconds. It then asks: "Do you really want to open this?"
- **The Result:** Often, the answer is "No, I was just bored." This micro-pause is enough to bring your conscious brain back online.


### Case Study: The YouTube Detox
YouTube is a prime example of a platform that can be either a university or a slot machine. The default homepage is designed to distract you.

**The Fix:**
- **Install an Extension:** Use browser extensions like [Unhook](https://unhook.app/) or [DF Tube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/df-tube-distraction-free-y/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgmkkfikjj) (Distraction Free YouTube).
- **Hide the Junk:** Configure these tools to hide YouTube Shorts, the comments section, and the algorithmic sidebar recommendations.
- **Redirect to Subscriptions:** Set your default view to the *Subscriptions* page. This ensures you only see content from creators you've actively chosen to follow, turning the platform from a random feed into a curated library.

### The Instagram Paradox (Chat Only)
Instagram is often a double-edged sword: it's how we stay in touch with friends, but the "price" of admission is wading through a swamp of algorithmic reels and ads.

**The Fix:**
You don't need the app to use the chat.
- **Use an Aggregator:** Apps like **[Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/)** or **[Texts](https://texts.com/)** allow you to connect your Instagram Direct Messages to a single, clean inbox that has *zero* news feed. You get the connection without the addiction.
- **Feed Blockers:** If you must keep the app, tools like **[BeTimeFul](https://www.betimeful.com/)** or modified Android clients can strip the feed entirely, leaving only the functional parts.

### NextDNS: The Firewall for Your Brain
Willpower is a finite resource. Don't rely on it. Instead, block the distractions at the network level.

**The Fix:**
- **[NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)**: This is a free functionality that works as a "firewall" for your internet connection.
- **How it works:** You recognize specific domains that are harmful to your focus (e.g., `tiktok.com`, gambling sites, or ad servers). You add them to your blocklist.
- **The Result:** When you try to load these sites—whether on your phone, laptop, or tablet—they simply won't load. It cuts the loop before it even starts.

### Fixed Device Locations (The "Simone Giertz" Rule)
We've made our devices portable, so they follow us everywhere: to the toilet, to the bed, to the dinner table. This ubiquity is the root of the problem.

**The Fix:**
Give your devices a permanent home.
- **Laptops:** stay on the desk. They are work tools, not lap warmers for the sofa.
- **Phones:** live in a specific bowl in the hallway or a charger in the kitchen.
- **The "Plant" Holder:** Queen of Shitty Robots, **Simone Giertz**, created a brilliant [device that grows a plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyM3A7C85QI) only when her phone is placed inside it. If she removes her phone, the light turns off, and the plant dies. It’s a tangible, living reminder that your phone belongs in its place, not in your hand.

### The Weekly Blackout (Kill the Router)
Sometimes the only way to win is not to play. Pick one day a week (maybe Sunday) to just... turn it off.

**The Fix:**
- **Manual Mode:** Walk over to your router. Pull the plug. Enjoy the silence. Pretend it's 1995 or that the internet is "down" for maintenance.
- **Automate It:** Use a simple smart plug to schedule this. Set it to cut power at 8:00 AM on Sunday and restore it at 8:00 AM on Monday. It requires zero willpower when the house itself decides it's time to disconnect.

### The Double-Edged Sword of AI
AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini are incredible for brainstorming, summarizing, or finding quick answers. They are the "convenience store" of the internet: fast, cheap, and accessible.

**The Risk:**
- **Nutritional Void:** Just as fast food fills you up without nourishing you, AI can give you an answer without understanding.
- **Misinformation:** AI hallucinations are real. It can confidently state falsehoods as facts.
- **Atrophy of Critical Thinking:** If you outsource every question and creative thought to a bot, your own cognitive muscles weaken. You stop connecting dots yourself.

**The Fix:**
- **Use it as a Sous-Chef, not the Head Chef:** Let it chop the vegetables (brainstorm, summarize), but *you* do the cooking (critical analysis, final decisions).
- **Fact Check:** Treat AI output as a rough draft, not the final truth. Verify important claims. Don't let it replace your own judgment.
