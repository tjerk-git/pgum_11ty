# Developing a creative mindset in an age of distractions

In this lecture I will be talking about all the self-help books I read. Some were about creativity, some were about changing your life, some were about finding purpose. Apparently these are the subjects that interest me. But also have a clear link in how to become a good design student.
Some of these books were actually meta-analyses on all self-help books.

The books I will be referring to are:

The reason I find this subject so very interesting is because it tells us about how creative humans work, and what biases and pitfalls each human has, so we can learn from them and work around them. Mostly creative people have problems with motivation / procrastination and distractions, and I find myself the prime example. Also, we’re quite neurodivergent crowd.

So this lecture will not be personal, but I will use personal examples.
We don’t want to dive in my pitfalls and personality but it is at some times quite opinionated so be aware. Also sometimes I like to add drama to things to make a point, so again be aware of bias and drama.

And every now and then, I will have a philosophy slide, a slide to think about, or not, it’s not required.

So BIAS slide, philosophy slide and opinion slide, alright let’s go.

## The Flywheel

Each of my lessons, I’ve assembled into a concept I learned called a flywheel. I found this concept in the boek *Intentioneel Leven*, and I would like to use it to motivate you in your learning.

Each of these flywheels could be a goal for your learn competency.

A flywheel saves up speed and progress you already made and makes it easier for you to start up again. Each of these tips adds to a flywheel, which when some of these tips are done by you, it will put momentum in this flywheel.

Believe me when you have these metaphorical flywheels spinning, it feels easier and easier to get started with something new.

### The flywheel for design students

1. (Really) Challenge yourself
2. Remove Distractions and take breaks
3. Be intentional and learn to love the process
4. Make a plan
5. Celebrate

# 1. (Really) challenge yourself

This is where my first theories come in, the first one is called *Flow* by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

It’s actually quite simple, he invented the term we know and use as *flow*.

If you do something that isn’t challenging for you, you get bored. So you might want to look for distractions or do something else.

If you do something that is way too challenging for you, you might feel insecure, out of your depth or even demotivated to pick it up again.

But if you do something that challenges you just the right amount it takes over your focus, you forget the distractions and suddenly it’s 3am and the project just screams for more. That’s flow state baby.

!TODO, maybe more depth about this

So challenging yourself is rewarding for your focus and attention and also, the sense of accomplishment.

## Eat that frog

The second one, is a term popularized by (Mark Twain and Brian Tracy). Get the hard part out of the way first. Lots of self-help books reiterate on this concept. And if you explain it to people it always feels logical. Let me sketch you two situations.

It’s Sunday and you have to take out the garbage can outside, it’s raining and will take about 5 minutes. You hate taking the garbage out, it has become the most difficult thing because it is raining and you are in your pajamas and only want to play video games.

One scenario is where you postpone doing this for the entire day. You sit on your couch, play video games but every now and then a thought creeps in your head: “Damn, I still need to take the garbage out.” You get this thought maybe 5 times during the day, at the end of the day you do it.

In the other scenario, you instantly put on a raincoat, walk outside, grab the garbage can, and put it outside and then play video games all day.

I believe that in the first scenario you kept yourself prisoner of the negative task you had to do. In the second one you are instantly free of your burdens.

## The first draft of anything is shit

So in Dutch we have a saying, a saying that is as old as this country I think. “Driemaal is scheepsrecht.” So the “scheepsrecht” is a term that comes from the world of sailing and boats, it also means straight or right, kinda both (Dutch language is confusing sorry). I like to imagine that when the Dutch had these beautiful giant ships they sailed around the world in to steal stuff (sorry), parking that damn thing would be too hard to get it right in one go. So this saying captures imperfection of it all, and the acceptance that you will probably need to try three times to get it right.

\[an image of a USB stick]

Maybe just accept this, right now, with designing. Maybe the third time will be the charm. You need to get through the first and second time just only to learn. To get started, to get over the hump. These tries were not about the end result but about starting the process, and that’s more important — getting over that hump, getting started.

Also if we teachers see that your iterations had real struggle and lessons learned (and not only the subtle change of colour or moving the logo a bit) we will reward you with EC’s. How could we not?

### Philosophy slide

“If putting in an effort (mental or physical) makes you release endorphins (thus making you happy), has this age of comfort and services made us less human?”

# 2. Remove distractions and take breaks

It’s time to talk about distractions. If anything can pull you out of your focus and creative process, it’s external influences and distractions.

First off, distractions and breaks are not the same. Taking a break is intentionally stopping the work to unwind and get some energy back. Please take breaks!

Distractions are disturbances that get you out of the flow state.

Lots of these self-help books talk about structuring and managing when and how much information you receive. They talk about rituals, only checking your messages twice a day. The common conclusion is that distractions are horrible for your creative and work process. So structuring how you work and how you set up your work environment is vital.

So let’s talk about what kind of relationship you have with your phone. I’ve seen people who are in the full Pavlov stage of their relationship with their phone. For the people who don’t know Pavlov, he famously did an experiment with his dog and a bell. Every time before he would feed his dog, he would ring the bell. After a while, the dog started drooling when the bell rang. So it attached the concept of getting food with the ringing of the bell.

Every time I see someone’s phone buzz, I see their hand reach to it. Even if it’s in the middle of an important conversation, even if you are in social groups, the reaction comes before you know it.

The book I would like to refer to is *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport, and the points that help most are the following:

* Clutter is costly: Too many apps and devices consume your time and attention, diminishing overall life quality.
* Remove as many notifications as humanly possible for you
* Optimization is important: It’s not just about which technologies you use, but how you use them to maximize benefit.
* Intentionality is satisfying: Being deliberate about your technology use brings meaningful satisfaction beyond convenience.

So clean up your phones, do a 30-day cleanse, be intentional about what you do use and why, and what you don’t use.

Remove distractions but do take breaks.

### Opinion slide:

Some people say that TikTok can be inspiring, but for me it’s the same as saying that Cola contains water. Yes, there is some water in Cola, but you are ignoring it’s mostly sugar, and sugar in high amounts is bad for you. And so is TikTok, remove it.

# 3. Be intentional and love the process

Being a designer can look like it’s about results. “My website is online”,  “My poster is on the wall”, “My logo is being used”, “Look at my finished video!”

But what we really should appreciate (especially in the time of A.I.-generated crap) is the effort and learning someone had to go through to get to it.

\[video of someone power washing their driveway]

## Opinion slide

Another reason I hate TikTok is that you see someone power washing their driveway but you get none of the satisfied feelings of doing it your damn self. Who likes these videos? Everyone does, because it tricks you into thinking you did a job well done. You didn’t. You are still on the toilet and you accomplished nothing. Stop fooling yourself with these dopamine traps.

So that’s where *Atomic Habits* kicks in. Be a person where drawing or doodling is fun enough. Where experimenting with code is good enough as an activity, just you know\... for fun. Maybe edit some videos just for nobody to see, just because you are curious.

The source of motivation of a good habit or new skill comes from the feeling of growth as a person, it’s your personality that’s changing. Running a 5k one time won’t change you, but running every week will.

### Philosophy slide

“Character is what you do when no one is watching.”

So when you start a new goal, think longer about what the intention is for you as a person or designer, instead of the goal you want to reach.

“I want to run a 5k because I want to become a fitter person.”

I see a lot of self-sabotage in design students. Students barely start and they are already critical of their own work. “It sucks, it’s not finished, don’t look at this yet” — and this brings me to my next point.

There is a time for judging and a time for playing. This is a lesson I learned from my drawing teacher — I find him a great teacher. When I was really stuck in an exercise where I had to redraw something, I found myself constantly being too scared to draw a first line, afraid that each line would not match what I was trying to do. He explained to me that this is ridiculous. “There is a time for playing and a time for judging. Now is the time for play,” he said. It’s the balance between these two modes that makes your drawing “good.” So he made it very clear when I can judge my work and compare it to others and when I should accept I am just trying to get it right.

So become a Player → or a Referee → to a Coach for yourself.
The Player plays and wants to have fun, not think about the rules too much, just keep the outlines of the rules in the back of the mind. The Referee wants to be strict and correct and stop play if the rules are being broken. The Coach wants everyone to play their best, no matter the outcome.

You can be aware and intentional about these roles when you are creating. Also works great for feedback by the way. de Bono, E. (1985). Six thinking hats. Little, Brown and Company.


Perfect — thanks for the clarity. Here’s your original Dutch text translated into **clear, engaging English**, while keeping the structure and tone consistent with your book so far:

# 4. Make a Plan

> “A goal without a plan is just a wish.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Creativity isn’t magic. If you don’t give your creative energy a sense of direction, it’ll just scatter — and that’s a waste. This chapter is about how to create a simple but effective system to actually follow through on your ideas — without boxing yourself in.

## 1. Start at the end

In *Building a Second Brain*, Tiago Forte talks about “Intermediate Packets”: small, self-contained chunks of work that are easy to find, reuse, and build upon. These help you stay clear-headed and make your ideas more tangible.

So always ask yourself:

* What’s the end goal?
* What’s the *smallest possible next step* that moves me closer to it?

Use this mindset when you're:

* Starting a design sprint
* Preparing a pitch
* Mapping out your learning goals for the semester

## 2. Plan backwards

A lot of students plan forward (“I need to be done by then”), but it’s often way more effective to plan in reverse: start at your deadline and work back in logical steps to today.

> “Reverse engineering your own progress gives you power over deadlines.”

Use a simple template like this:

* Final date: what must be finished?
* Halfway point: what should be done by then?
* First milestone: what’s the first tangible result?
* First action: what can I do *today*?

Bonus tip: try using an analog planning board or bullet journal. Off-screen = fewer distractions.

## 3. Pick your system (and keep it simple)

Not every plan needs to live inside Notion, Trello, or Obsidian. In fact, a physical whiteboard or paper planner is often more powerful. The key is: choose a system that fits *you*, and *stick to it*.

Examples of simple systems:

* **The “3 Tasks a Day” Rule** (from *Eat That Frog!*): 1 big task, 2 small ones
* **Habit tracking** (from *Atomic Habits*): track what you do daily
* **Sunday Reflection Ritual**: review your week and plan the next (great with a buddy or mentor)

## 4. Leave room for the unexpected

A plan isn’t a prison — it’s a framework for creativity. Make room for inspiration, spontaneous ideas, or even a total pivot. But let that happen by choice, not because you lost the plot halfway through.
